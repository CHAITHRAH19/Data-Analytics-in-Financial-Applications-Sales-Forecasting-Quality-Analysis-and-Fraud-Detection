# Data-Analytics-in-Financial-Applications-Sales-Forecasting-Quality-Analysis-and-Fraud-Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository focuses on a data analytics project in financial applications, covering sales forecasting, production quality analysis, and credit card fraud detection.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Forecast Sales Trends**
   Analyze historical retail sales data and predict future sales patterns using linear regression and trend analysis.

2. **Enhance Production Quality**
   Perform statistical analysis on product quality metrics to identify relationships between pricing, ratings, and perceived quality.

3. **Improve Fraud Detection**
   Apply statistical and anomaly detection techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and evaluate model performance.
